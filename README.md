## Overview
This was the project completed for the UWA unit CITS3001 (Agents, Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence). The purpose of this project was to develop a game and then create an AI to play this game. The game was a blue team vs red team style game, situated in a theoretical political enviromnent, where the blue team and red team can release different messages to a population to affect their opinion.
